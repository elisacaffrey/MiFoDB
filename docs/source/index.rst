Welcome to MiFoDB
===================================

**MiFoDB** is a workflow for the alignment-based profiling of microbes associated with microbial foods.
This workflow includes a tripartite database (MiFoDB_v2), as well as details to expand and build an alignment based database. 
In addition to high accuracy profiling results, MiFoDB's incorporation into the InStrain (Olm et al. 2021) framework allows for strain tracking, functional analysis, and gene profiling within the same workflow.
