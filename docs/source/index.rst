Welcome to MiFoDB
===================================

**MiFoDB** is a workflow designed for the alignment-based profiling of microbes associated with microbial foods.
This workflow includes instructions on how to analyze your own fermented food samples from the raw sequencing data to profiling the results and downstream analysis.
We inlude a tripartite database (MiFoDB), as well as details to expand and/or build your own an alignment based database. 

In addition to high accuracy and low false positive profiling results, MiFoDB's incorporation into the `InStrain (Olm et al. 2021) <https://instrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ framework allows for strain tracking, functional analysis, and gene profiling within the same workflow.

Check out the :doc:`overview` section for further information.
