Welcome to MiFoDB
===================================

**MiFoDB** is a workflow for the alignment-based profiling of microbes associated with microbial foods.
This workflow includes a tripartite database (MiFoDB_v2), as well as details to expand and build an alignment based database. 
In addition to high accuracy profiling results, MiFoDB's incorporation into the `InStrain (Olm et al. 2021) <https://instrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ framework allows for strain tracking, functional analysis, and gene profiling within the same workflow.

Check out the :doc:`overview` section for further information.
